1. When using database transactions to ensure data consistency, the database aborted soon after the server started. We changed
the database connection from one for all threads to one for each thread, then the server and database worked as expected.

2. Invalid data displayed at the end of the responsed receieved by clients. We changed the response format from char[] to vector<char>,
then the receieved response content is as expected.

3. Refund amount was incorrect when executing orders, so we changed the refund amount to execution amount and solved this problem.

4. When matching orders, if orders were placed in a short time, we cannot tell the time difference between different orders,
so we added trans_id as a factor that should be considered when matching ordres.

5. We added error checking to handle invalid XML format.
